## PICFLIX.AI

PicFlix.ai is a browser-based application that uses neural style transfer. It's a tensorflow.js model that supports neural style transfer at its core. As with any other neural style transfer model, it accepts a content image and a style picture and produces a content image drawn in the style of the style image. As a result, using an art work as a style picture, we can turn a regular content image into an artistified one.

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!
